# Magic-Python
Using the power of computer vision algorithms and a Raspberry Pi, you can be able to execute gesture-based actions. This project
was first shown at Maker Faire Austin 2019.

# How to Use
There are several libraries that need to be installed, but the most important one is the OpenCV library. For the Raspberry Pi 3 
running Raspbian Stretch, a full set of instructions can be found here on how to install the OpenCV library (**NOTE** It takes 
a long time to install the library as it requires a lot of processing power to build). Similarly, my website includes a break
down on the way the code works. In the coming weeks, I plan on making a more generalized version of spell_actions.py so that
anyone can use it with any action or actuator. Here is a link to the blog article: https://www.brokenrobotlabs.com/2019/05/austin-maker-faire-2019.html
